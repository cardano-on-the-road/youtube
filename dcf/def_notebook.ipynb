    "### Cost of debt\n",
    "he cost of debt is the effective interest rate that a company pays on its debts, such as bonds and loans. The cost of debt can refer to the before-tax cost of debt, which is the company’s cost of debt before taking taxes into account, or the after-tax cost of debt. The key difference in the cost of debt before and after taxes lies in the fact that interest expenses are tax-deductible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost of equity\n",
    "The cost of equity is the return that a company requires to decide if an investment meets capital return requirements. Firms often use it as a capital budgeting threshold for the required rate of return. A firm’s cost of equity represents the compensation that the market demands in exchange for owning the asset and bearing the risk of ownership. The traditional formula for the cost of equity is the dividend capitalization model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk free\n",
    "The risk-free rate of return is the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk. The risk-free rate represents the interest an investor would expect from an absolutely risk-free investment over a specified period of time.\n",
    "The so-called \"real\" risk-free rate can be calculated by subtracting the current inflation rate from the yield of the Treasury bond matching your investment duration.\n",
